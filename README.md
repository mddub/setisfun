# setisfun

A JavaScript implementation of [Set][1], an amazing card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974. Currently powering http://setisfun.com.

I wrote the bulk of this code in spring 2011, before JavaScript and I became _much_ better acquainted. I've made small changes since then, but the structure remains a mess. You've been warned.
